    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This apple cider chicken could not be simpler or more delicious. Chicken breasts cook first in sage-infused
        butter, then return to a sweet-sour pan sauce of reduced apple cider and vinegar. The pan sauce is then finished
        to glistening perfection in the classic French style with a chunk of cold butter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>6 sage leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot or onion</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups apple cider</li>
        <li>1/3 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat; add sage leaves and fry until crisp, 1 to 2
            minutes. Remove and reserve.</li>
        <li>Add chicken breasts to the same skillet, and cook until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.
            Remove to a plate and cover loosely with foil.</li>
        <li>Add shallots to the skillet; saut√© for 1 minute. Pour in cider and vinegar, and bring to a simmer over
            medium-high heat. Cook until reduced by half, which will only take a few minutes. Reduce heat to low and
            place chicken back in, along with any accumulated juices from the plate. Cook for a few minutes, turning
            occasionally, and basting with the hot sauce until the chicken is hot. An instant read thermometer inserted
            into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a serving plate.</li>
    </ol>
